This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Router DOM v6 and above, where navigating to a non-existent route results in unexpected behavior rather than a proper 404 error. The `bug.js` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using the `useLocation` hook and a custom `NoMatch` component to gracefully handle such situations.  The problem stems from how React Router handles unmatched routes, leading to potential blank screens or other unexpected rendering.
